# ðŸ¤¯ WTC - What The Compiler

Welcome to **WTC**, a C compiler that asks the same question you do every time your code compiles but *doesnâ€™t* run:  
**"What the compiler!?"**

---

## ðŸ˜µ What is this?

WTC is a cursed love letter to the C language, written by someone who thought writing their own compiler was a good idea.  
It probably wasn't. But here we are.

---

## âœ¨ Features (kinda)

- Parses some C code (emphasis on *some*)
- Yells at you with cryptic error messages (like a real compiler!)
- Generates something resembling code
- Sometimes segfaults before your code even gets to
- Includes **zero undefined behavior** because *everything* is undefined here

---

## ðŸ›  How to Build (if you dare)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wtc.git
cd wtc
make
